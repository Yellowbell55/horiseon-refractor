# Horiseon-Refractor Module 1 Challenge Exercise

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this Challenge project is to refactor code (improve upon without changing functionality) for the Horiseon Solution Services, Inc. website by meeting standards of web accessibility and following the Scout Rule. The Scout Rule recommends the coder leave the code cleaner than when they first found it to provide long-term sustainability.

<ul>
