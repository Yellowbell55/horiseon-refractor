# Horiseon-Refractor Module 1 Challenge Exercise

## PURPOSE
The purpose of this Challenge project is to refactor code (improve upon without changing functionality) for the Horiseon Solution Services, Inc. website by meeting standards of web accessibility and following the Scout Rule. The Scout Rule recommends the coder leave the code cleaner than when they first found it to provide long-term sustainability.

## USER STORY

A marketing agency site that provides social services has asked us to improve its accessibility standards to better optimize its search engines.


## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

To meet their expectations, I made these changes:
<ul>
    <li>Documented changes with comments before changes made to each element or section of the page.
    <li>Changed non-semantic HTML elements to semantic HTML elements visible in the source code.
    <li>Reworked the CSS by consolidating CSS selectors and properties to improve efficiency.
    <li>Organized the elements in logical structure, independent of styling and positioning.
    <li>Added accessible alt attributes now visible when viewing the image elements.
    <li>Updated sequential order of the heading attributes in both the CSS and HTML files.
    <li>Updated the title to a concise, descriptive title, specifically the company's full name.
